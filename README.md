For fun project by Gregory Hilston and Andrew Boutin. 

TO DO:
    
    1. Items/Inventory/Character Stats - Need to set up areas to display items 
       being worn, inventory slots, character name/lvl/etc.
    2. Combat Dialogue - Need to figure out how we're going to display messages, update them, etc.
    3. Need to have house map and town map
          Make door usable to go back and forth between
    4. (IMPORTANT) Need to develope game loop
    5. Need to add in NPC and randomized movement    
    6. Need to add in enemy and create path finding towards character
    
Minor Fixes Needed:
    Need to get floor to appear under character when moving and under door when occupied.
    Need to create arraylist of images at each location in order that they should be painted.
