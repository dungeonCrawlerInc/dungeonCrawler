For fun project by Gregory Hilston and Andrew Boutin. 

TO DO:
    
    Items/Inventory/Character Stats - Need to set up areas to display items 
       being worn, inventory slots, character name/lvl/etc.
       
    Combat Dialogue - Need to figure out how we're going to display messages, update them, etc.
    
    (IMPORTANT) Need to develope game loop for moving all movable objects on grid
    
    Need to add in NPC and randomized movement
    
    Need to add in enemy and create path finding towards character
    
    Switch over from grid square types to gridType interface - branch out different classes of objects
    Give doors information that will allow them to load new levels
    
    LEVEL DESIGNER
    Add in save button instead of saving in combo box
    Add in fill method
    Add in line method
    Add in load method to load saved levels to edit
    
    Have grid hold arrayLists of grid squares - draw them in order (floor, table...) so correct floor tiles show beneath
    
Minor Fixes Needed:


    Have character names text file be a resource so it doesn't get created on user's desktop
    Need to create arraylist of images at each location in order that they should be painted.
